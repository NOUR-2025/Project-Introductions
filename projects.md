**Title:** Langauge communities and the field of low-resource NLP

**Summary:** This work is a literature survey exploring how the natural-language processing (NLP) research field currently works with speakers of low-resource languages. Low-resource languages are those where NLP systems (e.g., machine translation, speech-to-text, autocomplete, datasets) are sparsely available. Addtionally, human-computer interaction (HCI) has been focusing more on community-focused engagement. This work examines in what ways do NLP researchers interact with speakers from these communities and discusses how HCI scholarship can help NLP foster better community relations.
