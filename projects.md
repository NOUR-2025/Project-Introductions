**Title: Enhancing Robotic Instruction Understanding through Multimodal Human Cues**

**Summary: This project investigates how integrating human gaze (eye-tracking) and manual gestures with spoken language instructions can improve a robot’s ability to understand and execute commands. By analyzing multimodal inputs—eye movement, hand movement, and verbal utterances—the system aims to bridge the gap between natural human communication and machine interpretation, paving the way for more intuitive and accurate human-robot interaction.**

**Title:** Mental health support on online forums across various demographics

**Summary:** This project is aimed at analyzing the effectiveness of mental health support on online forums and how the preferences of different demographics vary when seeking support. Additionally, we are analyzing how LLM-based chat bots are able to provide mental health support based on these varying preferences. The four main demographics that this project focuses on are gender, military, employment, and parenting.

**Title:**Making Quantum Information Science More Understandable for Students K-12

**Summary:**By using LLMS and game models, make complex topics in QIS and Quantum Computing more digestible for students. Quantum Computing uses various abstract concepts from physics and linear algebra. By making technology more tailored to students in high school, I hope to examine the most effective ways to teach these topics.

**Title:** Langauge communities and the field of low-resource NLP

**Summary:** This work is a literature survey exploring how the natural-language processing (NLP) research field currently works with speakers of low-resource languages. Low-resource languages are those where NLP systems (e.g., machine translation, speech-to-text, autocomplete, datasets) are sparsely available. Addtionally, human-computer interaction (HCI) has been focusing more on community-focused engagement. This work examines in what ways do NLP researchers interact with speakers from these communities and discusses how HCI scholarship can help NLP foster better community relations.
