**Title:** Visual Analysis and Machine Learning Detection of Network Attacks

**Summary:** This project focuses on understanding and analyzing the CIC-IDS2017 dataset to detect network intrusions using machine learning. At first, the goal is to visually inspect network traffic using Python to identify differences between attack and non-attack periods. This initial analysis will help build a foundation for selecting relevant features, understanding attack patterns, and developing effective models for intrusion detection in later phases of the project.

**Title:** Langauge communities and the field of low-resource NLP

**Summary:** This work is a literature survey exploring how the natural-language processing (NLP) research field currently works with speakers of low-resource languages. Low-resource languages are those where NLP systems (e.g., machine translation, speech-to-text, autocomplete, datasets) are sparsely available. Addtionally, human-computer interaction (HCI) has been focusing more on community-focused engagement. This work examines in what ways do NLP researchers interact with speakers from these communities and discusses how HCI scholarship can help NLP foster better community relations.
